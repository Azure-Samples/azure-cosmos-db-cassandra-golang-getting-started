# Quickstart: Connect a Go application to Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed multi-model database. One of the supported APIs is the Cassandra API. This sample walks you through creation of keyspace, table, inserting and querying the data using the gocql driver. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). Or [try Azure Cosmos DB for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cosmosdb/) without an Azure subscription. 
- [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your computer, and a working knowledge of Go.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Setup

Clone the application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-cassandra-golang-getting-started
```

### Installation

To configure the application, open `cassandra.go` and replace `ACCOUNTNAME` and `PASSWORD` with values from the portal.  

### Use the X509 certificate

1. Download the Baltimore CyberTrust Root certificate locally from [https://cacert.omniroot.com/bc2025.crt](https://cacert.omniroot.com/bc2025.crt). Rename the file using the file extension `.cer`.

   The certificate has serial number `02:00:00:b9` and SHA1 fingerprint `d4ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª20:d0:5e:66:fc:53:fe:1a:50:88:2c:78:db:28:52:ca:e4:74`.

2. Change the `<path/to/cert.pem>` in `cassandra.go` to point to your new certificate.

3. Save `cassandra.go`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you experience a certificate related error in the later steps and are running on a Windows machine, ensure that you have followed the process for properly converting a .crt file into the Microsoft .cer format below.
> 
> Double-click on the .crt file to open it into the certificate display. 
>
> Click `Copy to File`.
>
> :::image type="content" source="./media/crtcer1.gif" alt-text="View and verify the output":::
>
> Press Next on the Certificate Wizard. Select Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER), then Next.
>
> :::image type="content" source="./media/crtcer2.gif" alt-text="View and verify the output":::
>
> Select Browse (to locate a destination) and type in a filename.
> Select Next then Finished.
>
> You should now have a properly formatted .cer file. Ensure that the path in `uprofile.js` points to this file.

Change into the directory where you cloned the application and build it (using `go build`).

```bash
cd azure-cosmos-db-cassandra-golang-getting-started
go build cassandra.go
```

### Running this sample

Run the sample from the same directory by typing `cassandra` and hitting return. You should see the following output:
